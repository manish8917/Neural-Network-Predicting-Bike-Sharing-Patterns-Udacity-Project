# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns (Neural-Network-Udacity-Project)
(https://github.com/manish8917/Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Neural-Network-Udacity-Project)

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
The first Udacity Project from the Deep Learning Nanodegree. Using only Numpy to implement forward and back propagation to predict Bike-Sharing Patterns. GitHub Logo

Setup:
Create a conda environment: Make sure you have installed: numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
conda create --name deep-learning python=3
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
Activate your environment:
Windows:
activate deep-learning
Mac/Linux:
source activate deep-learning
Run the notebook server in the root directory of the project:
jupyter notebook
The server is located in: localhost:8888
Open the Jupyter notebook called: Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
The data comes from: UCI Machine Learning Database
Results to expect:
Training and validation loss:

Predictions after training:

Conclusions
The predictions are acceptable but in the December the model overestimes bike ridership because it hasn't had sufficient holiday season training examples.


### Please Note:
### I've executed this project work on my local machine with all the project rubrics to meet all required specifications of Udacity Nanodegree Program & uploaded here for reference.
